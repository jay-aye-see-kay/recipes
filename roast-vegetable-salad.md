# Roast Vegetable Salad  
Serves 4-6  

## Ingredients
- 700g pumpkin, cut into wedges 
- 2 medium kumara, cut into 2 cm cubes 
- 2 medium beetroot, cut into 1 cm cubes (Beetroot takes longer to cook than pumpkin and kumara so cut beetroot about 1/2 the size.)  
- salt and pepper to taste 
- 2-3 tbsp olive oil 
- 1 head of garlic 
- 1/4 cup pine nuts 
- 200g baby spinach leaves (or more to taste) 
- 10-12 cherry tomatoes 
- 100g-150g feta cheese (to taste), cut into 1 cm cubes  
- 1/4 cup lemon juice  

## Preparation
Pre-heat oven to 200℃.  

Place pumpkin and kumara in a bowl, place beetroot in another bowl. Divide the oil and seasoning between these two bowls and mix until vegetables coated in oil. (You can put all in one bowl to coat in oil just be aware the beetroot will discolour the other vegetables.)  

Spread in single layer on oven tray. Keep beetroot to one end of the roasting dish or in a separate dish to stop colour bleeding.  

Roast for 30-40 minutes. (Hot oven and small amount of oil makes them brown and crispy.) 

Brush whole garlic head with oil, wrap in foil and place in roasting dish with vegetables. Remove when garlic is soft to touch after about 20-30 minutes.  

Lightly dry roast pine nuts in frypan until golden brown (watch closely as they burn easily).  

To serve: Place warm roast vegetables on bed of spinach leaves. Separate garlic cloves, squeeze garlic out of skins and sprinkle on top. Top with tomatoes, feta and pine nuts.  Drizzle with lemon juice.
