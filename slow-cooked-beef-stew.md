**Ingredients**
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 celery sticks, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp rapeseed oil
- 3 carrots, halved and cut into chunks
- 2 bay leaves
- ½ pack thyme
- 2 tbsp tomato purée
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 beef stock cubes or stock pots
- 900g beef for braising such as skirt, buy a whole piece and cut it yourself for bigger chunks or buy ready-diced
- 2 tsp cornflour (optional)
- ½ small bunch parsley, chopped
- buttery mash, to serve (optional)

**Method**
- Fry the onion and celery in 1 tbsp oil over a low heat until they start to soften – about 5 mins. 
- Add the carrots, bay and thyme, fry for 2 mins, stir in the purée and Worcestershire sauce, add 600ml boiling water, stir and tip everything into a slow cooker.
- Crumble over the stock cubes or add the stock pots and stir, then season with pepper (don’t add salt as the stock may be salty).
- Clean out the frying pan and fry the beef in the remaining oil in batches until it is well browned, then tip each batch into the slow cooker. 
- Cook on low for 8-10 hrs, or on high for 4 hrs.
- If you want to thicken the gravy, mix the cornflour with a splash of cold water to make a paste, then stir in 2 tbsp of the liquid from the slow cooker. 
- Tip back into the slow cooker, stir and cook for a further 30 mins on high. 
- Stir in the parsley and season again to taste. 
- Serve with mash, if you like. 
 
Leave to cool before freezing.
